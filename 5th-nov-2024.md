## What is HTTP?

### The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to load pages on the Internet using hyperlinks.

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is typically constructed from resources such as text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.

![request-response-example](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/diagrams/http/overview/fetching-a-page.svg)

Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.

Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an application layer protocol that is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.

## HTTP request methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the purpose of the request and what is expected if the request is successful. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each request method has it's own semantics, but some characteristics are shared across multiple methods, specifically request methods can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

### GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should not contain a request content.

### HEAD
The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without a response body.

### POST
The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

### PUT
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request content.

### DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

### CONNECT
The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

### OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

### TRACE
The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

### PATCH
The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

## HTTP response status codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

- Informational responses (100 – 199)
- Successful responses (200 – 299)
- Redirection messages (300 – 399)
- Client error responses (400 – 499)'
- Server error responses (500 – 599)

refer MDN for more detailed information on these response codes.

## What is a RESTful API?

RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application. RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and efficient software communication standards.

### What is REST?

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work. REST was initially created as a guideline to manage communication on a complex network like the internet. You can use REST-based architecture to support high-performing and reliable communication at scale. You can easily implement and modify it, bringing visibility and cross-platform portability to any API system.

API developers can design APIs using several different architectures. APIs that follow the REST architectural style are called REST APIs. Web services that implement REST architecture are called RESTful web services. The term RESTful API generally refers to RESTful web APIs. However, you can use the terms REST API and RESTful API interchangeably.

The following are some of the principles of the REST architectural style:

**Uniform interface**

The uniform interface is fundamental to the design of any RESTful webservice. It indicates that the server transfers information in a standard format. The formatted resource is called a representation in REST. This format can be different from the internal representation of the resource on the server application. For example, the server can store data as text but send it in an HTML representation format.

Uniform interface imposes four architectural constraints:

1. Requests should identify resources. They do so by using a uniform resource identifier.
2. Clients have enough information in the resource representation to modify or delete the resource if they want to. The server meets this condition by sending metadata that describes the resource further.
3. Clients receive information about how to process the representation further. The server achieves this by sending self-descriptive messages that contain metadata about how the client can best use them.
4. Clients receive information about all other related resources they need to complete a task. The server achieves this by sending hyperlinks in the representation so that clients can dynamically discover more resources.

**Statelessness**

In REST architecture, statelessness refers to a communication method in which the server completes every client request independently of all previous requests. Clients can request resources in any order, and every request is stateless or isolated from other requests. This REST API design constraint implies that the server can completely understand and fulfill the request every time. 

**Layered system**

In a layered system architecture, the client can connect to other authorized intermediaries between the client and server, and it will still receive responses from the server. Servers can also pass on requests to other servers. You can design your RESTful web service to run on several servers with multiple layers such as security, application, and business logic, working together to fulfill client requests. These layers remain invisible to the client.

**Cacheability**

RESTful web services support caching, which is the process of storing some responses on the client or on an intermediary to improve server response time. For example, suppose that you visit a website that has common header and footer images on every page. Every time you visit a new website page, the server must resend the same images. To avoid this, the client caches or stores these images after the first response and then uses the images directly from the cache. RESTful web services control caching by using API responses that define themselves as cacheable or noncacheable.

**Code on demand**

In REST architectural style, servers can temporarily extend or customize client functionality by transferring software programming code to the client. For example, when you fill a registration form on any website, your browser immediately highlights any mistakes you make, such as incorrect phone numbers. It can do this because of the code sent by the server.

## What’s the Difference Between JSON and XML?

- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

- XML stands for Extensible Markup Language

- Both JSON and XML can be used to receive data from a web server.

### JSON is Like XML Because

- Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
- Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
- Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
- Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest

### JSON is Unlike XML Because

- JSON doesn't use end tag
- JSON is shorter
- JSON is quicker to read and write
- JSON can use arrays

The biggest difference is:

 XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.

### Why JSON is Better Than XML

- XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
- JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.

## How session and cookies works ?

### What are Cookies?

Cookies provide a way for web applications to store information in the user’s browser. This information can be retrieved every time the user requests a page from the same web server that created the cookies.

Cookies can be either first-party or third-party. First-party cookies are created by the website that the user is visiting, while third-party cookies are created by domains other than the website being visited. Third-party cookies are often used for advertising and tracking purposes.

### High-level of how cookies work

First, a cookies is a text string stored by the browser as a key/value pair.

![cookies-key-value-pair](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*qUjOH5gQsRYAPQdnGG5OiQ.png)
Figure 01 : Examples of cookies

![cookies-in-browser](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*YWoWX0vcDMTsqzA3XdKOIQ.png)
Figure 02 : Examples of cookies in the browser

In Figure 02, we can see that there are three cookies: the user ID, the user theme, and a cookie named PHPSESSID that we will discuss later in the session section.

When a browser request a web page, the server create a cookie and return it to the browser as part of the response. The browser then store that cookie in the user’s computer.

Cookies have a expired date that’s set by the server, when that date come, the cookie will be deleted from the user’s browser.

The browser send back that cookie each time it request a web page from that server.

Browsers generally accept only 20 cookie from each site, and 300 cookies in total.

### What are Sessions?

Sessions are a way of storing information about a user on the server-side. Those information will then be used in subsequent requests.

By definition, a Web session is a sequence of network HTTP request and response transactions associated with the same user.

Sessions provides the ability to establish variables — such as access rights and localization settings — which will apply to each and every interaction a user has with the web application for the duration of the session.

Let’s take an example. Suppose you’re logged into a web application and you provide your username (or email) and password, then submit. Next, you are redirected to the dashboard page where you can access it if you’re logged in.

In a non-session mechanism, you’ll not be able to access the dashboard, even though you logged in. This is because HTTP requests are independent of each other. When you send the second request to the dashboard page URL, the server doesn’t know who you are.

In a session-based mechanism, when you log in, the server stores some information about you in the session variable (for example, creating a variable that store the authenticated user). In the next request, when you go to the dashboard page, the server recognizes you by checking that session variable and let you access the dashboard page.

### How session work ?

When a user logs into the website, a session is created. In this session, you can created variable called “session variable” that store data in a key/value format ( like cookies ).

This session is associated with a randomly generated unique ID, which is created by the server. It’s called “session ID”.

The generated session ID is then sent to the user’s browser and stored as a cookie, while the session data is stored on the server-side.

Now, when the browser send a request to the server, it’ll send the cookies with the request.

The server will receive the cookie from the incoming request and retrieve the value of the session ID.

![session communication example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*Mc3AiM1OIL4rH4DaC9m6Dg.png)

Afterwards, the server will search for the session and retrieve all the data stored within it once it is found.

`If you remember, we saw a cookie named PHPSESSID in the cookie section. Well, This cookie store the session ID of the active session. PHPSESSID is the default name given by the PHP back-end server that created the session ID.`

Let’s take a closer look at our previous example to understand what is happening in more detail.

When you log in, a session is created with a unique ID (session ID). The session ID will be sent to the user’s browser.

the server will then create a session variable auth_user ( for example ) and store in it the information of the actual logged in user. The session data will be stored in a file on the server side. The name of the file will be the session ID.

When the user request the dashboard page, the browser will send the cookie that contain the session ID with the request.

The server receives an incoming request, retrieves the session ID, and searches for the associated session. Once the session is found, the server retrieves the data.

Finally, the server will need to check the existence the that auth_user session variable. If he found it, the server will give the access to the dashboard page.

`Sessions are often used to store sensitive information such as user credentials and financial data. They are more secure than cookies because the information is stored on the server-side and not on the client-side.`

### How session are stored ?

I said later that session data are stored in a file in the server. Well, you should know that the session data are stored in different ways depending on the configuration.

For example, in PHP the default mechanism is to store the session in the file system This provides the advantage of simple file-based storage and the ability for sessions to exist for long periods of time.

Another way is to store the session data in a database, there are several advantages. You have better control over the length of a session, as you can control when the session data is cleared out. You have better security because the data is not stored in a common area

Most of the time, the session is stored in the cache for performance purposes, for example, if a website has a lot of users, it will be a good practice to store the session file in a cache so that the retrieval process will be fast.

## Authentication vs. Authorization

While often used interchangeably, authentication and authorization represent fundamentally different functions. In this article, we compare and contrast the two to show how they protect applications in complementary ways.

### What are authentication and authorization?

In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

Comparing these processes to a real-world example, when you go through security in an airport, you show your ID to authenticate your identity. Then, when you arrive at the gate, you present your boarding pass to the flight attendant, so they can authorize you to board your flight and allow access to the plane.

## What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0, which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user. It replaced OAuth 1.0 in 2012 and is now the de facto industry standard for online authorization. OAuth 2.0 provides consented access and restricts actions of what the client app can perform on resources on behalf of the user, without ever sharing the user's credentials.

Although the web is the main platform for OAuth 2, the specification also describes how to handle this kind of delegated access to other client types (browser-based applications, server-side web applications, native/mobile apps, connected devices, etc.)

### Principles of OAuth2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and NOT an authentication protocol. As such, it is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of resources, for example, remote APIs or user data.

OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens. An Access Token is a piece of data that represents the authorization to access resources on behalf of the end-user. OAuth 2.0 doesn’t define a specific format for Access Tokens. However, in some contexts, the JSON Web Token (JWT) format is often used. This enables token issuers to include data in the token itself. Also, for security reasons, Access Tokens may have an expiration date.

## Introduction to JSON Web Tokens

### What is JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.

### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:

**Authorization**: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different do*mains.

**Information Exchange**: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

### What is the JSON Web Token structure?

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

```
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
```

Let's break down the different parts.

**Header**

The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

For example:

```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.

**Payload**

The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.

- **Registered claims**: These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), and others.

Notice that the claim names are only three characters long as JWT is meant to be compact.

- **Public claims**: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.

- **Private claims**: These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.

An example payload could be:

```
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

The payload is then **Base64Url** encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.

Do note that for signed tokens this information, though protected against tampering, is readable by anyone. Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted.

**Signature**

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

**Putting all together**

The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact when compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.

The following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded, and it is signed with a secret.

![encoded-jwt](https://cdn.auth0.com/content/jwt/encoded-jwt3.png)

If you want to play with JWT and put these concepts into practice, you can use jwt.io Debugger to decode, verify, and generate JWTs.

![jwt.io-debugger](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/jwt/introduction/debugger.png)

### How do JSON Web Tokens work?

In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens longer than required.

You also should not store sensitive session data in browser storage due to lack of security.

Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema. The content of the header should look like the following:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

This can be, in certain cases, a stateless authorization mechanism. The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. If the JWT contains the necessary data, the need to query the database for certain operations may be reduced, though this may not always be the case.

Note that if you send JWT tokens through HTTP headers, you should try to prevent them from getting too big. Some servers don't accept more than 8 KB in headers. If you are trying to embed too much information in a JWT token, like by including all the user's permissions, you may need an alternative solution, like Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization.

If the token is sent in the Authorization header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won't be an issue as it doesn't use cookies.

The following diagram shows how a JWT is obtained and used to access APIs or resources:

![jwt-flow](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/jwt/introduction/client-credentials-grant.png)

1. The application or client requests authorization to the authorization server. This is performed through one of the different authorization flows. For example, a typical OpenID Connect compliant web application will go through the /oauth/authorize endpoint using the authorization code flow.
2. When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application.
3. The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API).

Do note that with signed tokens, all the information contained within the token is exposed to users or other parties, even though they are unable to change it. This means you should not put secret information within the token.

### Why should we use JSON Web Tokens?

Let's talk about the benefits of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) when compared to Simple Web Tokens (SWT) and Security Assertion Markup Language Tokens (SAML).

As JSON is less verbose than XML, when it is encoded its size is also smaller, making JWT more compact than SAML. This makes JWT a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments.

Security-wise, SWT can only be symmetrically signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm. However, JWT and SAML tokens can use a public/private key pair in the form of a X.509 certificate for signing. Signing XML with XML Digital Signature without introducing obscure security holes is very difficult when compared to the simplicity of signing JSON.

JSON parsers are common in most programming languages because they map directly to objects. Conversely, XML doesn't have a natural document-to-object mapping. This makes it easier to work with JWT than SAML assertions.

Regarding usage, JWT is used at Internet scale. This highlights the ease of client-side processing of the JSON Web token on multiple platforms, especially mobile.
